1.1.1 Computer Forensics Concepts and Types

What is Computer Forensics?
- A science and process of collecting, preserving, analyzing and reporting legally admissible evidence to court 

<< Quiz >>
(1) The order of steps in the forensics process is:
- Collect, preserve, analyze, report

(2) Which of the following are examples of Anti-Digital-Forensics (SDF)? (Select all that apply.)
- Hiding data in image or audio files
- Modifying file access time
- Modifying file modification time
- Overwriting data and metadata
- Renaming files by changing file extensions

1.1.2 Forensic Investigation Procedure

If the system is up and connected:
- If yes, may lose transient data and network configurations

Should we turn the compromised system off?
- Graceful shutdown 
  - may trigger rootkit to wipe the system off, losing all volatile and non-volatile data
  - System date and time
  - List of users currently logged on
  - Open files
  - List of running processes
  - List of open sockets
  - List of applications listening on open sockets
  - List of systems having current or recent connections to the systems
- Forceful shutdown (most situations) - will lose data stored in cache, volatile data and data not written to disk properly

Procedure:
1) Establish detailed chain of custody
    - Maintain a record of how evidence has been handled from the moment it was collected to the moment it was presented in court
    - Who, When, Where with timeline
    - Evidence to be stored in a tamper-proof manner
2) Working with evidence
    - Acquire
    - Authenticate 
    - Analysis
    - Present
   

<< Quiz >>
(1) True or False: A backup copy contains exactly the same data as a bit-image copy.
- False

(2) True or False: The chain of custody maintains a record of how evidence has been handled from the moment it was collected to the momment it is presented in a court.
- True

1.1.3 Data Acquisition

**Acquire**
  - Acquire volatile data first because they are have short life span
  - E.g. network interface info: ipconfig /all > xxx.txt (usually saved outside the compromised machine in order to preserve its integrity)
  - Bitstream copy the digital evidence to retrieve all deleted data together with the content
  - Tool: FTK imager, dd
  NOTE: FTK Imager does not guarantee that data is not written to the drive during imaging. For this reason, investigators will use a write blocker when using FTK Imager in a real case. To complete this activity, you can assume that you have a USB write blocker.
  
**Authenticate**
  - Digital evidence must be preserved in its original state
  - Law requires that evidence to be authentic and unaltered
  - Use collision-free Cryptographic Hash Algorithm for authentication (MD5 or SHA)
      - To preserve evidence
      - To conduct hash analysis for evidence matching
      - To positively verify that a file has been altered        
            
<< Quiz >>
(1) When copying evidence to a forensic drive, the forensic drive should be:
- Wiped clean

(2) True or False: A bitstream image is the same as a copy.
- False

1.1.4 Data Preservation

<< Quiz >>
(1) Computer forensics uses collision-free cryptographic hash algorithms to preserve evidence, because it:
- Guarantees that the same message always results in the same hash

(2) If you rename, myFile to myNewFile, will the hash value of myFile be the same or different than the hash value of myNewFile?
- Same

1.1.4 Data Analysis and Report

**Analyze**
Steps to Computer Forensics:
- Make bit-stream copy of evidence
- Preserve the evidence using collision-free cryptographic hash algorithms
- Analyze digital copy of evidence, and protect the original physical evidence as much as possible

Guide to Data Analysis:
- Look at partition table on the suspect drive to learn the number of partitions on the drive
- Check for gaps between partitions for hidden data
- Retrieve deleted files - investigate the recovered files
- Generate a timeline based on timestamps and the log files
- Find hidden data 
- Keyword search for related terms - list all search hits
- Perform signature analysis to identify fake extensions
- Perform hash analysis to filter out both innocent files and malicious files
- OS specific media analysis
- Glean evidence from registry - obtain registry values
- Collect information through recycle bin
- Look through emails, pictures, and web content, etc

**Present**
Guide to Reporting:
- Begin with specific task that is assigned to the forensic examiner
- Present the factual statements identified
- Include case description
- Include how the forensic examniers are involved
- Include initial evidence (e.g. suspect's machine, acquired image and hash value
- Show all findings including recovered files, registry values, keyword search hits, emails, pictures, and web content, etc 
- Include your opinion with supporting data
- Conclusion
      - Based on my knowledge, ...
      - This is my professional opinion ...
      - The finding/evidence indicates ...

Report Outline:
- Title Page - Case name, date, investigator name, contact information
- Table of Contents
- Executive Summary - high level view of important findings
- Objectives
- Evidence Analyzed - serial numbers, hash values, pictures taken at the scene, etc
- Steps Taken - results should be reproducible including software and hardware used, and version numbers
- Relevant Findings - documents of interest, internet activity, software of note, usb devices, etc
- Timeline - concise timeline of important events
- Conclusion - highligh important issues
- Signature
- Exhibits - CV, chain of custody documentation, supporting document linked from the body of the report, etc

Challenges of Computer Forensics:
- Increasing storage densities --> require fast speed imaging tools
- Cloud computing
- Pervasive Encryption
- SSD possibly destroy deleted data

<< Quiz >>
(1) A forensic report only includes the findings and conclusion.
- False

(2) A forensic investigator is allowed to offer his or her opinions in a forensic report based on the case evidence.
- True
