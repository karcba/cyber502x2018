Unit 2: Linux/Unix Acquisition

2.1 Linux/Unix Acqusition

[External source] Understanding Linux File Permissions
Permission Groups
(1) owner
(2) group
(3) all users

Permission Types
(1) read
(2) write
(3) execute - affects the user's capability to execute a file or view the contents of a directory

Format: _rwxrwxrwx 1 owner:group
_- Special permission flag
(rwx)1- owner permissions
(rwx)2- group permissions
(rwx)3- all users permissions

1- displays the number of hardlinks to the file

u- Owner
g- Group
o- Others
a- All Users

+ to add permissions
- to remove permissions

r- Read
w- Write
x- Execute

e.g. chmod a+rw filename.xxx

r = 4
w = 2
x = 1

e.g. chmod 640 filename.xxx to assign:
- read and write to owner
- read to group
- no permissiosn to all other users

(1) Which one of the following types of evidence is the most volatile evidence?
- Memory

(2) Which command can redirect data to a connected machine using TCP or UDP?
- netcat (nc)


2.1.1 Acquisition Preparation and System Information Acquisition

Four Basic Forensics Steps for Linux/Unix Systems
(1) Collect
(2) Perserve
(3) Analyze
(4) Present (Report)

Before a forensic investigation, we need to prepare beforehand:
- A set of forensic tools (bootable live CD or USB) containing trusted forensic tools
- A powerful machine with forensic tools installed
- A clean-wiped hard drive to store acquired evidence

Forensics tools
- Ensure forensically-sound operations that do not modify evidence
- Process data structure from the image bypassing kernel's support because we expect them to show deleted content and other data that is typically hidden
- Work on both images and live systems

Evidence (from most volatile to nonvolatile)
- Memory
- Swap space or Gagefile
- Network status and connections
- Processes running
- Files opened
- Hard drive media
- Removable media (CD, zip, USB, etc)

Linux commands:
- lsof : lists all open files belonging to all active processes
- lsof -i [ipadd]
- lsof -i 4 -a -p 1234 : lists all open IPV4 network files in use by the process pid 1234
- lsof /dev/hda3 : list all open files on device /dev/hda3
- lsof /u/abe/foo : find the process that has /u/abe/foo open
- lsof +l1 : lists all open files that have a link count less than 1
- date
- uptime
- uname -a
- ifconfig : whether it is in promiscuous mode (listening in to all network packets)
- ps -eaf | more
- netstat -at : to look at tcp only; by right should look at udp too
- w : shows who is currently logged in
- which passwd : see where the passwd is stored at
- find / -uid 0 -perm -4000 2>/dev/null : to find set UID programs

Tips:
- If you have to reboot the suspect machine, boot it with a forensic bootable CD because booting using its original OS will modify data and metadata
- Run forensic tools from your own USB or device
- Save the output outside of the compromised system
- Collecting volatile data will inevitably change data, hence to ensure a minimal impact to the original data, should use small footprint tools and always document every step that you take



2.1.2 Memory Acquisition

Acquite RAM with Physical Access to System
- Memdump
	- May not be able to dump out the restricted range of addresses for newer Linux distributions and Unix
- Linux Memory Extractor (LiME)
	- Loadable kernet module for acquiring Linux/Android physical memory
- Fmem
	- A kernel module fmem.ko that creates device /dev/fmem
	- sudo dd if=/dev/fmem of=fmem.dd
- Live Response by E-FENSE
	- Physical memory
	- Other system information
	- Insert the usb key to suspect machine
	- Collect using a menu of options
	- Eject the USB key and walk away
	X Limitation is that examiners have to access the physical system
- F-Response
	- Allow remote forensic aquisition
	- Uses a pair of dongle (suspect system and forensic system)
	- Run executable from suspect system, it acts as an agent and awaits for connection
	- Invoke executable from forensic system and connect to suspect system
	- Collect boast[most?] volatile and non-volatile data

Demo
- Lime tool on Linux machine
	- **make sure trusted tools are used and outputs all go to external drive**
	- **note down that you have inserted a lime module into the suspect system**
	- cd to folder holding lime tool
	- insmod lime-<version>-generic.ko "path=/<to external drive/<meaningful.name.bin> format=padded"
	- **after extracting the memory dump, do cleaning up to remove the lime module from the suspect machine**
	- lsmood | grep lime --> to find the lime module
	- remmod lime module
	- cd to evidence folder --> the memory dump .bin file should be there
	- strings -n 8(bytes) <memory_dump file>.bin | grep ^forensics --> this will dump out strings ?= 8 bytes, and starting with 'forensics'

<< Quiz >>
(1) List two host-based Linux/Unix memory acquisition tools. (There are four acceptable answers.)
- LiME or Fmem or Live Response or memdump

(2) True or False: There are no filesystem structures in a memory dump
- True
	
	
2.1.3 Forensic Imaging of Drives

Aquiring non-volatile data
- Common practice is to shut down the system and remove the drives for imaging
- **Certain types of hard drives and solid state drives may self-destroy any data on the drive when you remove the drive or power it off completely e.g. Toshiba
- Need to use high-speed forensic images i(up to 30 GB/min) e.g. Tableau series from Guidance Software
	- These imagers usually have built-in write blocker functionalities to ensure that the original drive data will not be modified
- Software-based imaging tools like FTK Imager and DD can also be used to create bit-stream copy of drives/	
	- But you will need to couple it with a write blocker to separate the original drives from the imaging software 

How does DD work?
- Reads input blocks one at a time from block level device and puts them into a buffer (memory), applies the selected conversioins, then outputs from buffer to the desired location with a default block size of 512 bytes
- DD can copy metadata and data blocks in their entirety
- Syntax dd if=<what-to-copy> of=<where-to-put>
- If 'of' is not defined, by default it will output results to stdout
- DD can redirect by pipe to netcat or other applications to send data
- Syntax dd if=<source path> | nc <ipadd> <port>
- DD options
	- bs=n (bytes) or nk (kilobytes)
		- larger block size (up to 8kB) can decrease imaging time
	- ibs=q obs=r (bytes)
	- count=s (blocks)
		- stops after you have transferred 's' input blocks of data
	- skip=n (blocks)
		- skip 'n' block ibs-sized blocks at start of input before copying
	- seek=n (block)
		- skip 'n' blocks obs-sized blocks in the output file before copying

<< Quiz >>
(1) Which of the following forensic disk imaging tools has the fastest speed for imaging?
- The Tableau series from Guidance Software

(2) dd uses the options _________ to carve out a portion of data blocks from a source.
- skip and count
	

2.1.4 Using dd Continued

X dd does not provide any feedback on its progress (e.g. still running or faced an error)
	By default, dd will continue to copy out data until the end of the file or drive until it encounters a bad sector or block that it cannot read. It will then just stop what it is doing.
	- Force it to continue using conv=noerror flag
		- usually used for forensic imaging to skip the unreadable sectors
		- bad sectors will be padded with zeros --> need to document this down to account for hash difference
	- conv=nonerror,sync --> sync option keep the sectors in the target device aligned with source device

X dd does not calculate hash value for the newly generated image
	- The forensic imaging process is done only if the hashes of the original source and dd image match

- dd can be used to wipe data with all zeros: dd if=<path>/zero of=<path> count=N where N is the number of sectors to wipe. 1 sector = 512bytes
- Department of Defense standard for unclassified harddrive dispersion is 3 passes over every byte, or even 7 passes
- After wiping, reformat drive

Steps:
(1) Physical removal of hard drive
	- phyically remove hard drive from suspect machine
	- connect suspect drive to forensics machine with
		- write blocker
		- clean and wiped with all zeros
(2) No removal of hard drive
	- connect suspect machine to forensics machine using a crossover cable or firewire cable
	- forensics machine will listen to port 8888
		- Move to a whole drive: nc -l -p 8888 > <FMpath>
		- Save as an image: nc -l -p 8888 > <name>.dd
	- run netcat on suspect machine
		- dd if=<path> | nc ipaddr 8888 -w 3 --> 'w' makes sure that the connection will be terminated after N seconds if unable to establish connection or idle

Examples:
- dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb
	- HDB will contain the data from source followed by a bunch of zeros
	- hash values will be different
- dd if=/dev/hda of=/case1/evidence.dd
	- HDB will contain the exact same data from HDA because of the nature of the .dd file
	- hash values will be the same


DD's siblings:
- SDD
- DCFLDD

<< Quiz >>
(1) Write a dd command that will wipe the drive /dev/hda with all zeros. (Check your answer carefully before submitting.)
- dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda

(2) True or False: The command nc –l –p 8888 > evidence.dd will store any data sent to port 8888 in the evidence.dd file
- True
