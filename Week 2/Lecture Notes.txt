Unit 2: Linux/Unix Acquisition

2.1 Linux/Unix Acquition

> Understanding Linux File Permissions (external)
	Permission Groups
	(1) owner
	(2) group
	(3) all users

	Permission Types
	(1) read
	(2) write
	(3) execute - affects the user's capability to execute a file or view the contents of a directory

	Format: _rwxrwxrwx 1 owner:group
	_- Special permission flag
	(rwx)1- owner permissions
	(rwx)2- group permissions
	(rwx)3- all users permissions

	1- displays the number of hardlinks to the file

	u- Owner
	g- Group
	o- Others
	a- All Users

	+ to add permissions
	- to remove permissions

	r- Read
	w- Write
	x- Execute

	e.g. chmod a+rw filename.xxx

	r = 4
	w = 2
	x = 1

	e.g. chmod 640 filename.xxx to assign:
	- read and write to owner
	- read to group
	- no permissiosn to all other users

2.1.1 Acquisition Preparation and System Information Acquisition
	Four Basic Forensics Steps for Linux/Unix Systems
	(1) Collect
	(2) Perserve
	(3) Analyze
	(4) Present (Report)

	Before a forensic investigation, we need to prepare beforehand:
	- A set of forensic tools (bootable live CD or USB) containing trusted forensic tools
	- A powerful machine with forensic tools installed
	- A clean-wiped hard drive to store acquired evidence

	Forensics tools
	- Ensure forensically-sound operations that do not modify evidence
	- Process data structure from the image bypassing kernel's support because we expect them to show deleted content and other data that is typically hidden
	- Work on both images and live systems

	Evidence (from most volatile to nonvolatile)
	- Memory
	- Swap space or Gagefile
	- Network status and connections
	- Processes running
	- Files opened
	- Hard drive media
	- Removable media (CD, zip, USB, etc)

	Linux commands:
	- lsof : lists all open files belonging to all active processes
	- lsof -i [ipadd]
	- lsof -i 4 -a -p 1234 : lists all open IPV4 network files in use by the process pid 1234
	- lsof /dev/hda3 : list all open files on device /dev/hda3
	- lsof /u/abe/foo : find the process that has /u/abe/foo open
	- lsof +l1 : lists all open files that have a link count less than 1
	- date
	- uptime
	- uname -a
	- ifconfig : whether it is in promiscuous mode (listening in to all network packets
	- ps -eaf | more
	- netstat -at : to look at tcp only; by right should look at udp too
	- w : shows who is currently logged in
	- which passwd : see where the passwd is stored at
	- find / -uid 0 -perm -4000 2>/dev/null : to find set UID programs

	Tips:
	- If you have to reboot the suspect machine, boot it with a forensic bootable CD because booting using its original OS will modify data and metadata
	- Run forensic tools from your own USB or device
	- Save the output outside of the compromised system
	- Collecting volatile data will inevitably change data, hence to ensure a minimal impact to the original data, should use small footprint tools and always document every step that you take

2.1.2 Memory Acquisition
	Acquite RAM with Physical Access to System
	- Memdump
		- May not be able to dump out the restricted range of addresses for newer Linux distributions and Unix
	- Linux Memory Extractor (LiME)
		- Loadable kernet module for acquiring Linux/Android physical memory
	- Fmem
		- A kernel module fmem.ko that creates device /dev/fmem
		- sudo dd if=/dev/fmem of=fmem.dd
	- Live Response by E-FENSE
		- Physical memory
		- Other system information
		- Insert the usb key to suspect machine
		- Collect using a menu of options
		- Eject the USB key and walk away
		X
