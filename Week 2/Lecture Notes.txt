Unit 2: Linux/Unix Acquisition

2.1 Linux/Unix Acquition

> Understanding Linux File Permissions (external)
	Permission Groups
	(1) owner
	(2) group
	(3) all users

	Permission Types
	(1) read
	(2) write
	(3) execute - affects the user's capability to execute a file or view the contents of a directory

	Format: _rwxrwxrwx 1 owner:group
	_- Special permission flag
	(rwx)1- owner permissions
	(rwx)2- group permissions
	(rwx)3- all users permissions

	1- displays the number of hardlinks to the file

	u- Owner
	g- Group
	o- Others
	a- All Users

	+ to add permissions
	- to remove permissions

	r- Read
	w- Write
	x- Execute

	e.g. chmod a+rw filename.xxx

	r = 4
	w = 2
	x = 1

	e.g. chmod 640 filename.xxx to assign:
	- read and write to owner
	- read to group
	- no permissiosn to all other users
	
	<<Quiz>>
	(1) Which one of the following types of evidence is the most volatile evidence?
	> Memory
	
	(2) Which command can redirect data to a connected machine using TCP or UDP?
	> netcat (nc)

2.1.1 Acquisition Preparation and System Information Acquisition
	Four Basic Forensics Steps for Linux/Unix Systems
	(1) Collect
	(2) Perserve
	(3) Analyze
	(4) Present (Report)

	Before a forensic investigation, we need to prepare beforehand:
	- A set of forensic tools (bootable live CD or USB) containing trusted forensic tools
	- A powerful machine with forensic tools installed
	- A clean-wiped hard drive to store acquired evidence

	Forensics tools
	- Ensure forensically-sound operations that do not modify evidence
	- Process data structure from the image bypassing kernel's support because we expect them to show deleted content and other data that is typically hidden
	- Work on both images and live systems

	Evidence (from most volatile to nonvolatile)
	- Memory
	- Swap space or Gagefile
	- Network status and connections
	- Processes running
	- Files opened
	- Hard drive media
	- Removable media (CD, zip, USB, etc)

	Linux commands:
	- lsof : lists all open files belonging to all active processes
	- lsof -i [ipadd]
	- lsof -i 4 -a -p 1234 : lists all open IPV4 network files in use by the process pid 1234
	- lsof /dev/hda3 : list all open files on device /dev/hda3
	- lsof /u/abe/foo : find the process that has /u/abe/foo open
	- lsof +l1 : lists all open files that have a link count less than 1
	- date
	- uptime
	- uname -a
	- ifconfig : whether it is in promiscuous mode (listening in to all network packets
	- ps -eaf | more
	- netstat -at : to look at tcp only; by right should look at udp too
	- w : shows who is currently logged in
	- which passwd : see where the passwd is stored at
	- find / -uid 0 -perm -4000 2>/dev/null : to find set UID programs

	Tips:
	- If you have to reboot the suspect machine, boot it with a forensic bootable CD because booting using its original OS will modify data and metadata
	- Run forensic tools from your own USB or device
	- Save the output outside of the compromised system
	- Collecting volatile data will inevitably change data, hence to ensure a minimal impact to the original data, should use small footprint tools and always document every step that you take

2.1.2 Memory Acquisition
	Acquite RAM with Physical Access to System
	- Memdump
		- May not be able to dump out the restricted range of addresses for newer Linux distributions and Unix
	- Linux Memory Extractor (LiME)
		- Loadable kernet module for acquiring Linux/Android physical memory
	- Fmem
		- A kernel module fmem.ko that creates device /dev/fmem
		- sudo dd if=/dev/fmem of=fmem.dd
	- Live Response by E-FENSE
		- Physical memory
		- Other system information
		- Insert the usb key to suspect machine
		- Collect using a menu of options
		- Eject the USB key and walk away
		X Limitation is that examiners have to access the physical system
	- F-Response
		- Allow remote forensic aquisition
		- Uses a pair of dongle (suspect system and forensic system)
		- Run executable from suspect system, it acts as an agent and awaits for connection
		- Invoke executable from forensic system and connect to suspect system
		- Collect boast[most?] volatile and non-volatile data

	Demo
	- Lime tool on Linux machine
		- **make sure trusted tools are used and outputs all go to external drive**
		- **note down that you have inserted a lime module into the suspect system**
		- cd to folder holding lime tool
		- insmod lime-<version>-generic.ko "path=/<to external drive/<meaningful.name.bin> format=padded"
		- **after extracting the memory dump, do cleaning up to remove the lime module from the suspect machine**
		- lsmood | grep lime --> to find the lime module
		- remmod lime module
		- cd to evidence folder --> the memory dump .bin file should be there
		- strings -n 8(bytes) <memory_dump file>.bin | grep ^forensics --> this will dump out strings ?= 8 bytes, and starting with 'forensics'
		
	<<Quiz>>
	(1) List two host-based Linux/Unix memory acquisition tools. (There are four acceptable answers.)
	> LiME or Fmem or Live Response or memdump
	
	(2) True or False: There are no filesystem structures in a memory dump
	> True
	
2.1.3 Forensic Imaging of Drives
	Aquiring non-volatile data
	- Common practice is to shut down the system and remove the drives for imaging
	- **Certain types of hard drives and solid state drives may self-destroy any data on the drive when you remove the drive or poewr it off completely e.g. Toshiba
	- Need to use high-speed forensic images i(up to 30 GB/min) e.g. Tableau series from Guidance Software
		- These imagers usually have built-in write blocker functionalities to ensure that the original drive data will not be modified
	- Software-based imaging tools like FTK Imager and DD can also be used to create bit-stream copy of drives/	
		- But you will need to couple it with a write blocker to separate the original drives from the imaging software 
	
	How does DD work?
	- Reads input blocks one at a time from block level device and puts them into a buffer (memory), applies the selected conversioins, then outputs from buffer to the desired location with a default block size of 512 bytes
	- DD can copy metadata and data blocks in their entirety
	- Syntax dd if=<what-to-copy> of=<where-to-put>
	- If 'of' is not defined, by default it will output results to stdout
	- DD can redirect by pipe to netcat or other applications to send data
	- Syntax dd if=<source path> | nc <ipadd> <port>
	- DD options
		- bs=n (bytes) or nk (kilobytes)
			- larger block size (up to 8kB) can decrease imaging time
		- ibs=q obs=r (bytes)
		- count=s (blocks)
			- stops after you have transferred 's' input blocks of data
		- skip=n (blocks)
			- skip 'n' block ibs-sized blocks at start of input before copying
		- seek=n (block)
			- skip 'n' blocks obs-sized blocks in the output file before copying
